        <p>
            Shrek is a 2001 American computer-animated fantasy comedy film loosely based on the 1990 children's picture
            book of the same name by William Steig. Directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson (in their feature
            directorial debuts) and written by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Joe Stillman, and Roger S. H. Schulman, it is
            the first installment in the Shrek film series. The film stars Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and
            John Lithgow. In the film, an embittered ogre named Shrek (Myers) finds his home in the swamp overrun by
            fairy tale creatures banished by the obsessive ruler Lord Farquaad (Lithgow). With the help of Donkey
            (Murphy), Shrek makes a pact with Farquaad to rescue Princess Fiona (Diaz) in exchange for regaining control
            of his swamp.
